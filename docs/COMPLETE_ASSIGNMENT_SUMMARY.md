# Complete Assignment Summary: Inventory Management System for B2B SaaS

## Assignment Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All three parts of the assignment have been successfully implemented and documented.

---

## Part 1: Code Review & Debugging ✅ COMPLETE

### Issues Identified:

1. **No Input Validation**: Direct access to `data['key']` without checking existence
2. **No Error Handling**: Missing try-catch blocks for database operations
3. **Missing Field Validation**: No validation for price (must be positive), warehouse_id existence
4. **No Authentication/Authorization**: Anyone can create products for any warehouse
5. **Hardcoded Relationship**: Assumes product can only be in one warehouse initially
6. **Missing Status Field**: No way to track if product is active/inactive

### Impact in Production:

- **Security Risk**: Unauthorized product creation across companies
- **Poor UX**: Cryptic errors when validation fails
- **Data Integrity Issues**: Invalid data can corrupt the database
- **Business Logic Violations**: Products could be created without proper validation

### Fixed Implementation:

- **File**: `corrected_implementation.js`
- **Language**: Node.js with Express (as requested)
- **Features**:
  - Comprehensive input validation using Joi
  - Proper error handling with try-catch blocks
  - Authentication and authorization checks
  - Transaction management for data consistency
  - Duplicate SKU prevention
  - Proper status tracking

## Part 2: Database Design ✅ COMPLETE

### Schema Design:

- **File**: `db_design.js`
- **Tables Created**:
  - `companies` - Company information
  - `users` - User authentication and authorization
  - `warehouses` - Warehouse management per company
  - `product_categories` - Product categorization with thresholds
  - `products` - Product information with hierarchical thresholds
  - `bundle_components` - Product bundle relationships
  - `suppliers` - Supplier information
  - `product_suppliers` - Product-supplier relationships
  - `inventory` - Current inventory levels
  - `inventory_movements` - Audit trail for inventory changes
  - `sales_transactions` - Sales data for velocity calculations

### Design Decisions:

- **Indexing Strategy**: All frequently queried columns indexed
- **Constraints**: Proper foreign keys and unique constraints
- **Audit Trail**: Complete inventory movement tracking
- **Scalability**: Support for multiple companies, warehouses, and products

### Missing Requirements Identified:

- User authentication and authorization details
- Multi-company user access patterns
- Pricing rules and variations
- Unit tracking (pieces, kg, liters, etc.)
- Role-based permissions

## Part 3: API Implementation ✅ COMPLETE

### Primary Implementation:

- **File**: `low_stock_alerts.js`
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/companies/{company_id}/alerts/low-stock`
- **Summary Endpoint**: `GET /api/companies/{company_id}/alerts/low-stock/summary`

### Business Rules Implementation:

1. ✅ **Low stock threshold varies by product type**: Hierarchical system (product → category → default)
2. ✅ **Only alert for products with recent sales activity**: 30-day configurable window
3. ✅ **Handle multiple warehouses per company**: Warehouse-specific filtering and alerts
4. ✅ **Include supplier information for reordering**: Primary supplier details with lead times

### Technical Features:

- **Complex SQL Query**: Uses CTEs for optimal performance
- **Edge Case Handling**: Comprehensive error scenarios covered
- **Security**: Input validation, authorization, SQL injection prevention
- **Performance**: Indexed queries, efficient joins
- **Flexibility**: Optional warehouse filtering, configurable date thresholds

### Supporting Files:

- **Tests**: `low_stock_alerts.test.js` - Comprehensive unit tests
- **Documentation**: `LOW_STOCK_ALERTS_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Detailed technical guide
- **Examples**: `example_usage.js` - Client library and usage examples

## Key Assumptions Made

### Database Schema Assumptions:

1. **Company Isolation**: Each company has isolated data
2. **User Access**: Users belong to specific companies
3. **Product Categories**: Categories have default thresholds
4. **Supplier Relationships**: Products can have primary suppliers
5. **Inventory Tracking**: Real-time inventory levels with audit trail

### Business Logic Assumptions:

1. **Sales Velocity**: Recent sales indicate future demand
2. **Threshold Hierarchy**: Product-specific overrides category defaults
3. **Supplier Priority**: Primary suppliers for reordering
4. **Alert Frequency**: Real-time alert generation
5. **Stockout Calculation**: Based on average daily sales

### Technical Assumptions:

1. **Authentication**: Bearer token-based authentication
2. **Database**: PostgreSQL with Sequelize ORM
3. **Performance**: Query optimization for large datasets
4. **Security**: Input sanitization and authorization checks
5. **Monitoring**: Structured logging and error tracking
